                he World Wide Web, also known as the WWW and the Web, is an information space where documents and other
                web resources are identified by Uniform Resource Locators (URLs), interlinked by hypertext links, and
                accessible via the Internet.<span>[1]</span> English scientist Tim Berners-Lee invented the World Wide
                Web in 1989. He wrote the first web browser in 1990 while employed at CERN near Geneva,
                Switzerland.[2][3] The browser was released outside CERN in 1991, first to other research institutions
                starting in January 1991 and to the general public on the Internet in August 1991.

                The World Wide Web has been central to the development of the Information Age and is the primary tool
                billions of people use to interact on the Internet.[4][5][6] Web pages are primarily text documents
                formatted and annotated with Hypertext Markup Language (HTML).[7] In addition to formatted text, web
                pages may contain images, video, audio, and software components that are rendered in the user's web
                browser as coherent pages of multimedia content.
            </p>
            <p>
                Embedded hyperlinks permit users to navigate between web pages. Multiple web pages with a common theme,
                a common domain name, or both, make up a website. Website content can largely be provided by the
                publisher, or interactively where users contribute content or the content depends upon the users or
                their actions. Websites may be mostly informative, primarily for entertainment, or largely for
                commercial, governmental, or non-governmental organisational purpose.

                <h1>History</h1>
                <p>
                    Tim Berners-Lee's vision of a global hyperlinked information system became a possibility by the
                    second half of the 1980s.[8] By 1985, the global Internet began to proliferate in Europe and the
                    Domain Name System (upon which the Uniform Resource Locator is built) came into being. In 1988 the
                    first direct IP connection between Europe and North America was made and Berners-Lee began to openly
                    discuss the possibility of a web-like system at CERN.[9] In March 1989 Berners-Lee issued a proposal
                    to the management at CERN for a system called "Mesh" that referenced ENQUIRE, a database and
                    software project he had built in 1980, which used the term "web" and described a more elaborate
                    information management system based on links embedded in readable text: "Imagine, then, the
                    references in this document all being associated with the network address of the thing to which they
                    referred, so that while reading this document you could skip to them with a click of the mouse."
                    Such a system, he explained, could be referred to using one of the existing meanings of the word
                    hypertext, a term that he says was coined in the 1950s. There is no reason, the proposal continues,
                    why such hypertext links could not encompass multimedia documents including graphics, speech and
                    video, so that Berners-Lee goes on to use the term hypermedia.[10]
                </p>
                <p>
                    With help from his colleague and fellow hypertext enthusiast Robert Cailliau he published a more
                    formal proposal on 12 November 1990 to build a "Hypertext project" called "WorldWideWeb" (one word)
                    as a "web" of "hypertext documents" to be viewed by "browsers" using a client–server
                    architecture.[11] At this point HTML and HTTP had already been in development for about two months
                    and the first Web server was about a month from completing its first successful test. This proposal
                    estimated that a read-only web would be developed within three months and that it would take six
                    months to achieve "the creation of new links and new material by readers, [so that] authorship
                    becomes universal" as well as "the automatic notification of a reader when new material of interest
                    to him/her has become available." While the read-only goal was met, accessible authorship of web
                    content took longer to mature, with the wiki concept, WebDAV, blogs, Web 2.0 and RSS/Atom.[12]
                </p>
                <p>
                    The proposal was modelled after the SGML reader Dynatext by Electronic Book Technology, a spin-off
                    from the Institute for Research in Information and Scholarship at Brown University. The Dynatext
                    system, licensed by CERN, was a key player in the extension of SGML ISO 8879:1986 to Hypermedia
                    within HyTime, but it was considered too expensive and had an inappropriate licensing policy for use
                    in the general high energy physics community, namely a fee for each document and each document
                    alteration. A NeXT Computer was used by Berners-Lee as the world's first web server and also to
                    write the first web browser, WorldWideWeb, in 1990. By Christmas 1990, Berners-Lee had built all the
                    tools necessary for a working Web:[13] the first web browser (which was a web editor as well) and
                    the first web server. The first web site,[14] which described the project itself, was published on
                    20 December 1990.[15]
                </p>
                <p>
                    The first web page may be lost, but Paul Jones of UNC-Chapel Hill in North Carolina announced in May
                    2013 that Berners-Lee gave him what he says is the oldest known web page during a 1991 visit to UNC.
                    Jones stored it on a magneto-optical drive and on his NeXT computer.[16] On 6 August 1991,
                    Berners-Lee published a short summary of the World Wide Web project on the newsgroup
                    alt.hypertext.[17] This date is sometimes confused with the public availability of the first web
                    servers, which had occurred months earlier. As another example of such confusion, several news media
                    reported that the first photo on the Web was published by Berners-Lee in 1992, an image of the CERN
                    house band Les Horribles Cernettes taken by Silvano de Gennaro; Gennaro has disclaimed this story,
                    writing that media were "totally distorting our words for the sake of cheap sensationalism."[18]
                </p>
                <p>
                    The first server outside Europe was installed at the Stanford Linear Accelerator Center (SLAC) in
                    Palo Alto, California, to host the SPIRES-HEP database. Accounts differ substantially as to the date
                    of this event. The World Wide Web Consortium's timeline says December 1992,[19] whereas SLAC itself
                    claims December 1991,[20][21] as does a W3C document titled A Little History of the World Wide
                    Web.[22] The underlying concept of hypertext originated in previous projects from the 1960s, such as
                    the Hypertext Editing System (HES) at Brown University, Ted Nelson's Project Xanadu, and Douglas
                    Engelbart's oN-Line System (NLS). Both Nelson and Engelbart were in turn inspired by Vannevar Bush's
                    microfilm-based memex, which was described in the 1945 essay "As We May Think".[23]
                </p>
                <p>
                    Berners-Lee's breakthrough was to marry hypertext to the Internet. In his book Weaving The Web, he
                    explains that he had repeatedly suggested that a marriage between the two technologies was possible
                    to members of both technical communities, but when no one took up his invitation, he finally assumed
                    the project himself. In the process, he developed three essential technologies:
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>a system of globally unique identifiers for resources on the Web and elsewhere, the universal
                        document identifier (UDI), later known as uniform resource locator (URL) and uniform resource
                        identifier (URI);</li>
                    <li>the publishing language HyperText Markup Language (HTML);</li>
                    <li> the Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP).[24]</li>
                </ul>
                <p>
                    The World Wide Web had a number of differences from other hypertext systems available at the time.
                    The Web required only unidirectional links rather than bidirectional ones, making it possible for
                    someone to link to another resource without action by the owner of that resource. It also
                    significantly reduced the difficulty of implementing web servers and browsers (in comparison to
                    earlier systems), but in turn presented the chronic problem of link rot. Unlike predecessors such as
                    HyperCard, the World Wide Web was non-proprietary, making it possible to develop servers and clients
                    independently and to add extensions without licensing restrictions. On 30 April 1993, CERN announced
                    that the World Wide Web would be free to anyone, with no fees due.[25] Coming two months after the
                    announcement that the server implementation of the Gopher protocol was no longer free to use, this
                    produced a rapid shift away from Gopher and towards the Web. An early popular web browser was
                    ViolaWWW for Unix and the X Windowing System.

                    Wide Web Consortium.
                    Scholars generally agree that a turning point for the World Wide Web began with the introduction[26]
                    of the Mosaic web browser[27] in 1993, a graphical browser developed by a team at the National
                    Center for Supercomputing Applications at the University of Illinois at Urbana–Champaign
                    (NCSA-UIUC), led by Marc Andreessen. Funding for Mosaic came from the US High-Performance Computing
                    and Communications Initiative and the High Performance Computing Act of 1991, one of several
                    computing developments initiated by US Senator Al Gore.[28] Prior to the release of Mosaic, graphics
                    were not commonly mixed with text in web pages and the web's popularity was less than that of older
                    protocols in use over the Internet, such as Gopher and Wide Area Information Servers (WAIS).
                    Mosaic's graphical user interface allowed the Web to become, by far, the most popular Internet
                    protocol. The World Wide Web Consortium (W3C) was founded by Tim Berners-Lee after he left the
                    European Organization for Nuclear Research (CERN) in October 1994. It was founded at the
                    Massachusetts Institute of Technology Laboratory for Computer Science (MIT/LCS) with support from
                    the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA), which had pioneered the Internet; a year
                    later, a second site was founded at INRIA (a French national computer research lab) with support
                    from the European Commission DG InfSo; and in 1996, a third continental site was created in Japan at
                    Keio University. By the end of 1994, the total number of websites was still relatively small, but
                    many notable websites were already active that foreshadowed or inspired today's most popular
                    services.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Connected by the Internet, other websites were created around the world. This motivated
                    international standards development for protocols and formatting. Berners-Lee continued to stay
                    involved in guiding the development of web standards, such as the markup languages to compose web
                    pages and he advocated his vision of a Semantic Web. The World Wide Web enabled the spread of
                    information over the Internet through an easy-to-use and flexible format. It thus played an
                    important role in popularising use of the Internet.[29] Although the two terms are sometimes
                    conflated in popular use, World Wide Web is not synonymous with Internet.[30] The Web is an
                    information space containing hyperlinked documents and other resources, identified by their
                    URIs.[31] It is implemented as both client and server software using Internet protocols such as
                    TCP/IP and HTTP. Berners-Lee was knighted in 2004 by Queen Elizabeth II for "services to the global
                    development of the Internet".[32][33]

                <p>The terms Internet and World Wide Web are often used without much distinction. However, the two are
                    not the same. The <dfn>Internet</dfn> is a global system of interconnected computer networks. In
                    contrast, the
                    World Wide Web is a global collection of documents and other resources, linked by hyperlinks and
                    URIs. Web resources are accessed using HTTP or HTTPS, which are application-level Internet protocols
                    that use the Internet's transport protocols.[34]
                </p>
                <p>
                    The following example demonstrates the functioning of a web browser when accessing a page at the URL
                    http://www.example.org/home.html. The browser resolves the server name of the URL (www.example.org)
                    into an Internet Protocol address using the globally distributed Domain Name System (DNS). This
                    lookup returns an IP address such as 203.0.113.4 or 2001:db8:2e::7334. The browser then requests the
                    resource by sending an HTTP request across the Internet to the computer at that address. It requests
                    service from a specific TCP port number that is well known for the HTTP service, so that the
                    receiving host can distinguish an HTTP request from other network protocols it may be servicing. The
                    HTTP protocol normally uses port number 80 and for HTTPS protocol it normally is port number 443.
                    The content of the HTTP request can be as simple as two lines of text:
